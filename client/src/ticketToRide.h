    1. How to use:
        To connect to the server and play a game you have to call (in order):
            - ResultCode connectToCGS(const char *address, unsigned int port)
            - ResultCode sendName(const char *name)
            - ResultCode sendGameSettings(GameSettings gameSettings, GameData* gameData)

        You will then be connected to a game and will be able to play by calling:
            - ResultCode getMove(MoveData* moveData, MoveResult* moveResult)
            - ResultCode sendMove(const MoveData *moveData, MoveResult* moveResult)

    2. Constants:
        To communicate actions to the server you can use CONSTANTS variables, defined
        in enum types below, instead of hex code values.

        For exemple: use the TRAINING constant instead of code 0x1. It will greatly improve code readability.

    3. Defaults values for struct:
        You can instantiate struct with pre-set default values by using:
            - GameSettings gameSettings = GameSettingsDefaults;
            - GameData gameData = GameDataDefaults;

        This will reduce potential errors and unexpected behaviours.

    4. Every function will return an int (ResultCode) indicating the success / failure of the function.
        Possible error codes are:
            - 0x10: Param errors
            - 0x20: server / network errors
            - 0x30: other error
            - 0x40: all good

        Be sure to check return values of functions to handle errors. You may want to use the constants for better readability.

        Exemple: if(result == SERVER_ERROR) { ... }

    5. Memory management:
        Some functions are using malloc calls to allocate memory space. You will need
        to free those spaces.

        Variables that need to be freed are detailed in the comment of each function

        NOTE: you are likely to create multiple instance of MoveData, don't forget
        to free opponentMessage, or you will likely encounter Segmentation fault error.
